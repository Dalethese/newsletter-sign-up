### What I learned

In this project, I had the opportunity to tackle my first challenge created with React. As I have been learning React for a short time, it was an exciting and challenging experience. Through this project, I was able to apply my basic knowledge of React and gain more familiarity with the library.

Although this is just the beginning of my journey with React, I am excited to continue learning and exploring the features and possibilities that React offers.

#

### Continued development

In this section, I will outline the areas in which I plan to continue focusing on in future projects. These are concepts that I still don't feel completely comfortable with and techniques that I find useful and would like to refine and perfect.

- Deepen my knowledge in React: I want to explore more advanced concepts of React, such as using contexts, routing, and state management with Redux or other data flows.
- Improve my styling skills: I aim to enhance my CSS skills and explore styling frameworks and libraries like Styled Components to create more dynamic and styled interfaces.
- Learn advanced responsiveness techniques: I will continue studying and practicing advanced responsiveness techniques, such as using media queries and flexible grids, to create responsive and adaptable layouts for different devices.
- Deepen my understanding of testing: I plan to learn more about automated testing and how to implement unit tests and integration tests in my projects to ensure code quality and stability.
- Explore related libraries and tools: There are many libraries and complementary tools to React that I haven't fully explored yet, such as React Router, Redux, Axios, among others. I want to learn how to use them efficiently to improve my development skills.
